QUESTION:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

ANSWER:
    To share my work and collaborate with other people.
    To have an offsite backup of my project files.

QUESTION:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

ANSWER:
    Because there may be changes made in my local repository that I do not want to commit to my remote repository.

QUESTION:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

ANSWER:
    CLONE
    A clone is an exact copy of a repository. It can be done from a remote repository 
    or a local repository located in a different location on your computer.

    BRANCH
    A different version of a repository within the repository. You would use it
    when you want to experiment with new features without breaking the master version.

    FORK
    A copy of a repository on GitHub. It differs from a clone in that you can
    set it as a remote repository and make changes to it without affecting 
    the original repository. You would use when you want to make changes to a
    repository that you don't have write permissions or if you want to have a
    separate version of the repository while still giving credit to the original
    content creator.
